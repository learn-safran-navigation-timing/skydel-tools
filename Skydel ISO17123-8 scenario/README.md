# Skydel Scenarios replicating the ISO 17123-8 via GNSS simulation

## Description

This project contains two Skydel .sdx scripts that are used in multi-instance for a Skydel scenario used to replicate the test procedure described in the ISO 17123-8 procedure. In addition, it contains a .csv trajectory file that is loaded within the rover.sdx instance.
Please follow the "Simulating the ISO 17123-8 procedure through Skydel" application note released by Safran.

File description:
- base_station.sdx: Skydel instance for the base station.
- rover.sdx: Skydel instance for the rover instance.
- trajectory iso17123-8.csv: the trajectory file to be uploaded into the Skydel rover instance.

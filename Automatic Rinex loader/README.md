# RINEX File Download

This repository contains two scripts for downloading RINEX files from different sources and importing them into Skydel. The scripts are as follows:

## 1. Download via Websites

This script allows you to download RINEX files from specific websites. It uses a user-friendly web interface to specify download parameters such as date, location, and RINEX file type. Once the parameters are specified, the script connects to the website, retrieves the corresponding files, and saves them locally. Detailed steps on how to use this script are described in the README file of the corresponding script.

Please refer to the [README](skydel-tools/Automatic%20Rinex%20loader/FTP%20Website/README.md) file for detailed instructions on using the download script via websites.

## 2. Download via SecureSync

This script enables you to download RINEX files from a SecureSync server. It uses the provided authentication information to connect to the server, browse available files, and download the desired RINEX files. Details on configuring the authentication information and using the script are available in the associated README file.

Please refer to the [README](Automatic%20Rinex%20loader/SecureSync/README.md) file for detailed instructions on using the download script via SecureSync.

## Requirements

Make sure your development environment meets the following requirements before running the scripts:

- Python 3.8 or later.
- Dependencies specified in the requirements.txt files of each script.

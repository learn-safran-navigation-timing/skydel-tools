# Skydel Scenarios for RAIM Testing

## Description

This project contains two Skydel .sdx scripts that are both scenarios used for performing RAIM testing on receivers using Skydel. These scenarios are the one refered to in the "RAIM Testing withj Skydel" application note by Safran.   

Scenario description:
- Scenario 1: RAIM testing scenario using a full sky of GPS SV.
- Scenario 2: RAIM testing scenario using the minimum required number of SV to perform RAIM testing, with a high PDOP sky configuration to add stress on the receiver.
